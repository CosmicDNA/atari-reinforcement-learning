# Atari Reinforcement Learning with Stable-Baselines3 & RL Zoo

This project provides a streamlined setup for training and evaluating reinforcement learning agents on Atari 2600 games. It is based on the workflow demonstrated in this [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQsaH7Tzvp0&t=329s) and uses a collection of simple shell scripts to manage common tasks like training, evaluation, and video recording.

The core of the project leverages powerful libraries like Stable-Baselines3 and RL-Baselines3-Zoo to do the heavy lifting.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Cross-Platform Workflow:** Simple Python scripts (`train.py`, `enjoy.py` and `record-video.py`) to abstract away complex commands and ensure compatibility across platforms.
-   **Powered by RL Zoo:** Leverages the robust framework of `rl-zoo3` for training, evaluation, and hyperparameter management.
-   **Easy to Customize:** Scripts can be easily modified to train on different Atari games or with different RL algorithms.

## üöÄ Installation

The recommended way to install this tool is directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install atari-reinforcement-learning
```

This will make the `atari-rl` command available in your environment.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Atari ROMs**: This project uses `ale-py` to automatically download and install the necessary Atari ROMs during the dependency installation process. By proceeding with the installation, you are confirming that you have the legal right to use these ROMs.

## üéÆ Usage

### Train a New Agent

To start training an agent from scratch, run the training script. This will save logs and the trained model in the `logs/` directory.

```bash
atari-rl train
```

### Resume Training

If a training session was interrupted, you can resume from the last saved checkpoint.

```bash
atari-rl train --resume
```

### Watch the Agent Play

Once you have a trained model, you can watch it play the game. This script will load the best-performing model from your training history.

```bash
atari-rl enjoy
```

> [!TIP]
> To watch a specific experiment, add `--exp-id n`, where `n` is the experiment number.

### Record a Video

To save a video of your agent playing, use the recording script. The video will be saved in a `videos/` folder inside the corresponding log directory.

```bash
atari-rl record-video
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also specify the experiment ID with `--exp-id n` and the output format with `--format <svg|mp4|all>`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Setup

If you want to contribute to the project or modify the code, follow these steps to set up a development environment.

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CosmicDNA/atari-reinforcement-learning.git
    cd atari-reinforcement-learning
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install in editable mode with development dependencies**
    This installs the package in a way that your code changes are immediately reflected, and includes tools like `ruff` and `pytest` for development.

    *   **Using `uv` (recommended for speed):**
        ```bash
        pip install uv
        uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
        ```
    *   **Using `pip`:**
        ```bash
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
        ```

## üîß Customization

All experiment parameters are centralized in `src/atari_rl/config.py`. To change the game, algorithm, or hyperparameters for all scripts at once, simply edit this file.

For example, to train a **DQN** agent on **Pong**, you would modify `src/atari_rl/config.py` like this:
```python
ALGO = "dqn"
ENV = "ALE/Pong-v5"
```
